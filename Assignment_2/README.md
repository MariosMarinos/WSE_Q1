The code for Section 1.3. is in the same python file (Twitter_API.py) as we only change the filter depending on which task we want to achieve (filter by location for Amsterdam or filter with keywords for COVID-19.). Also, my first try was to save all the tweets in json file and then count them but for COVID I got a very big file (2.2GB) so I just decided to count the tweets on the fly.
